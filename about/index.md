## Hi, I'm Noah Ferrarotto. 

I'm an avid cyclist and lifelong sailor from Montreal, QC. For years, I have been fascinated by the woven layers that drape the intricate curves of sailboat hulls and bicycle frames. Throughout my four years studying mechanical engineering at McGill University, I have gained a considerable amount of knowledge and experience with design and manufacturing with composite materials. I strive to start my career in a high-energy environment that fosters creative thinking. 

Please enjoy a sneak peak of some projects I've worked on.
