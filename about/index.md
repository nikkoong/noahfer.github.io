Hi, I'm Noah Ferrarotto. 

I'm an avid cyclist and lifelong sailor from Montreal, QC.

For years, I have been fascinated by the woven layers that drape the intricate curves of sailboat hulls and bicycle frames. 

My studies in Mechanical Engineering further developed my passion for composite materials. 

Please enjoy a sneak peak of some projects I've worked on.
