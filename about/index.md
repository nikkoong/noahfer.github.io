Hi, I'm Noah Ferrarotto. 

I'm an avid cyclist and lifelong sailor from Montreal, QC.

For years, I have been fascinated by the woven layers that drape the intricate curves of sailboat hulls and bicycle frames. 

My studies in Mechanical Engineering further developed my passion for composite materials through my time at McGill Formula Electric, McGill Composites Lab and Rafale Sustainable Moth. 

I'm graduating from McGill University in June 2020 and am looking to pursue this passion and leverage the skills in design and manufacturing.

Please enjoy a sneak peak of some projects I've worked on.
