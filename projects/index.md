## Rafale.
### Sustainable Moth-class sailboat (hydrofoil subsystem)
For my senior year capstone project, I sparked the first ever McGill-ETS design team partnership to tackle the SuMoth Challenge: build a high-performance sailboat using sustainable materials and manufacturing processes. 

## CompositeCalc.
### MATLAB-based laminate calculator
I implemented course material learned in Prof. Larry Lessard's Mechanics of Composite Materials to compute safety factors based on ply schedule and material properties. 

## Core3D.
### 3D-printed cores for liquid composite moulding
I evaluated the capacity of additive manufacturing to enable the fabracation of more complex aerospace parts. 

## McGill Formula Electric.
### Formula SAE Electric (chassis subsystem)
I was introduced to the world of composite materials within McGill's electric racecar team. I learned the basics of laminate design and became familiar with the prepreg manufacturing process.
